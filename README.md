[Koko Analytics](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/) is a simple, open-source, lightweight (< 850 bytes) and privacy-friendly website analytics plugin for WordPress.

It aims to be a simple replacement for Google Analytics that respects the privacy of your visitors. Nothing visitor specific is tracked, only aggregated counts.
